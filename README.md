# WorkTimeReporting
This is a part of a 1-day (more like 4-hour) project, that communicates with the database. This part was made entirely by me.

Here I got to use databases more seriously for the first time.

The other two projects were made to add a new employee in the database, and to add information about your working hours.

Doing this was loads of fun, mainly because of by hilarious team members. But the schedule was also super tight,
so I had to maintain my focus to get this done.

Frequently heard: *Stupid jokes about construction workers*

"ADO what? I have been using the LinQ-thingy a lot more often?" (Here I learned the differences between ADO and EF)

"Eh... I'm not sure if I can accomplish the mvp with so little time..."

"X thing done! You can count it as done! *hands in the air*"

"Y thing done! I made it in time! *hands in the air*"
